\section{Selected Research Projects}

\cventry{2021-Present}{NIC Accelerated Active Messaging}{}{}{}{
RDMA is gaining popularity in datacenters for high-throughput
and low-latency network communication for building dis-aggregated systems.
However, there are many issues that are holding RDMA back from being widely deployed.
Current RDMA verbs are limited for diverse workloads, they are difficult to program,
and multiple round trips are required to do complicated memory operations e.g. walking a hash table.
We are working on creating a new network abstraction to make remote memory access more efficient, secure, and scalable
exploiting the programmability and offloading feature of smartNICs.
In our system, NIC offloads can be written in a high level language ensuring easy programmability,
then this will be converted into verifiable bytecode tailored to a specific workload and run on the NIC or host based on the dynamic load.
Program transformation, dynamic decisions, all these will be transparent to the developer.}

\cventry{2023-Present}{Software Architectures for Large-Scale Coherent Shared Memory}{}{}{}{
Emerging standards for cache coherent accelerators (e.g. CXL) will soon transform
how memory-intensive large-scale systems are developed.
Cache coherent accelerators are programmable (via FPGAs),
and they can interpose on CPU memory accesses at cache line granularitiy.
Low-overhead, granular access tracking with these coherent accelerators
enable efficient memory disaggregation. But disaggregation alone will
not fundamentally change application architecture. In this work we
are designing a new software architecture for building large scale services
that centers around coherent accelerators and rack-scale shared memory.}

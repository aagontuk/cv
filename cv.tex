\section{Bachelor Thesis}

\cvline{Title}{\emph{Power Efficient Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicle Using Buoyancy Chambers}}
\cvline{Supervisor}{Professor Dr. Md. Mashud Karim}
\cvline{Description}{In this thesis, a power efficient remotely operated underwater vehicle (ROV) has been built using buoyancy chambers.Conventionally, thruster motors are used for the propulsion of the ROV. In this system to keep the vehicle at rest in a fixed position under water, thruster motors are used and battery power is consumed continuously. This power loss can be removed by adding simple buoyancy mechanism. A control algorithm has been developed to control all the valves and pump. Also a computer program has been developed to communicate with the on board controller of the ROV.}
